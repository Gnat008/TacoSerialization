# TacoSerialization

Serialization for various components in Bukkit

# Want to Use This in Your Plugin?

If you're using TacoAPI for your plugin, you don't need to download this. TacoSerialization is included in TacoAPI.

## Embedding Code
TacoSerialization's only dependency is the included org.json package (and Bukkit packages, obviously). You may want to change the package names so they don't conflict with other plugins. However, I would prefer that the names follow these RegExs:

For com.kill3rtaco.tacoserialization:

   `.*\.tacoserialization`

For org.json:

   `.*\.json`

For those of you that don't know about RegExs, this means to keep 'tacoserialization' and 'json' at the end of the package names.
